Just a small update as not to lose the habit.
I did play a couple of chess games (on my phone though unfortunately).
Although I was tired I still managed to stick to my time management idea of not blundering away.
It's becoming ingrained.

Sometimes [this wasn't the case](https://lichess.org/roUUp1uw/black) but that's because of time trouble.
You can't expect not to blunder with only 10 seconds left on the clock.

Other games had exactly the game progress I wanted: slowly accumulating an advantage like [here](https://lichess.org/3RBqYdxG/black).

The [calculation mistakes I make](https://lichess.org/yMU8mPFT/white#33) should be easy to spot.
If your queen is in line of his rook, think twice.
Even if another piece is (temporarily) blocking the connection between your opponent's rook and your queen.

Having a chat group for each of my (current) interests (job postings, links, ...) is a great system.

I should create a list of small but very useful projects I want to tackle.
For example I'd like to be able to automatically get the dictionary entry of the meaning of words in [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections).
I always have to look up a couple of words in any case and sometimes a word has additional meanings I'm not aware of.
Another project is automatically creating dashboards with GH Actions (to fetch data from Lichess) + `awk` (to aggregate the data by a group) + `Datawrapper` (to create the automatically updating graphs) + basic HTML to show multiple `Datawrapper` [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe).
