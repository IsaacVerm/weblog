Starting off with 3 games of Blitz just to get the day started.
Excellent habit to get in the right mindset.

Time mananagement in [the first game](https://lichess.org/QtecyESL) was fine.
Took enough time for each move, but didn't get way behind on time.
The crucial mistake was underestimating his mating threat:

Qc7 would have liberated some place for my rook to go to d7 and defend b7.

In [this game](https://lichess.org/MIezJ3cm) I lost because I didn't take my chances.
I had a bishop and rook in the attack, both able to attack the f7 square but I didn't think about this plan and instead randomly began centralizing my bishop on e4. That bishop is not really better placed in the center.

In [the last game](https://lichess.org/YugDUfWN) I got into time trouble, even with an overwhelming advantage. But this shouldn't have happened. [At move 18](https://lichess.org/YugDUfWN/black#35) I had an advantage of 6.5 centipawns. After that I spent an excessive amount of time on obvious positions like this:

In this situation as Black there's no reason not to exchange. Simplify and just finish the game, no need to overthink.
