<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Hall">Theodore Hall Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In June 1946, Hall’s security clearance was revoked by the US Army, not over suspicions of being a Soviet asset but because of discovery of a letter he had received from his British sister-in-law, his brother Edward’s wife Edith, who inquired jokingly of him: “I hear you’re working on something that goes up with a big bang! Can you send us one of them for Guy Fawkes Day?”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statecraft.pub/p/how-to-commit-a-coup">How to Stage a Coup</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, King Hassan II of Morocco was the victim of a coup. His airplane was to be shot down coming back from Paris, but he landed and became very energetic, took control of the airbase, and then eventually tracked down the organizer of the coup, who was the minister of the interior, General Mohamed Oufkir. According to King Hassan’s New York Times obituary, “When pilots of his air force attacked his Boeing 727 jetliner, the King, himself a pilot, seized the radio and shouted, ‘Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!’ — fooling the rebels into breaking off their attack.”</p>

<p>One of the high points both for Martin, and the Trees in general, came when President Clinton used the drum riff from “Nearly Lost You” as the background during the Inauguration ceremony. “It was really weird, these tribal drums; but I thought it was pretty cool because I came up with that part.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Commodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the arena himself, dressed as a secutor. The Romans found Commodus’ gladiatorial combat to be scandalous and disgraceful. According to Herodian, spectators of Commodus thought it unbecoming of an emperor to take up arms in the amphitheater for sport when he could be campaigning against barbarians among other opponents of Rome. The consensus was that it was below his office to participate as a gladiator.</p>

<p>In August 2023, the Russian president publicly described the tech entrepreneur as “a talented person” — the same language he’d recently used when commenting on the violent death of mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who perished with several others in a plane crash under suspicious circumstances, two months after his brief but shocking armed insurrection.</p>

<p>In fact, there was a family tutor of the Einsteins who went by the name Max Talmud (possibly the best name of a tutor <em>ever</em>), and it was indeed Max Talmud who introduced the young 12-year-old Albert to geometry, prefacing young Albert’s eventual transformation of our understanding of space and time into something geometric.

<p>Emre told me one: “At yalanı, sikeyim inananı”.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam-%C4%B1_Kemal_jokes">Nam-ı Kemal jokes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nam-ı Kemal jokes (Turkish: Nâm-ı Kemâl fıkraları) are a variety of dirty jokes in Turkish folk literature that originated during the Ottoman era. In the archaic Ottoman Turkish language, the phrase nam-ı Kemal means " a man named Kemal“, i.e. a generic and unconventionally humorous everyman. However, due to the phrase’s vocal similarity with the name of one of the most foremost figures in Turkish literature, the poet and playwright Namık Kemal (1840–1888), the jokes underwent an evolution. With the growing obscurity of Ottoman terms among most speakers of modern Turkish,”nam-ı Kemal jokes" became, more often than not, “Namık Kemal jokes”, an example of a mondegreen. The obscenity of the “nam-ı Kemal jokes” tradition is based mainly on phallic exaggerations.</p>
