Starting with a good routine: a game of Blitz.
In earlier notes I started with 3 games of Blitz but some days that's too much.
Better to play just a single one and learn something from it.

This game was a good example.
I got way ahead (7+) and [became arrogant dropping a piece](https://lichess.org/C6LUYTeU/white#53).
In this game that wasn't the end of the world since I was that much ahead.
In other games you could get punished for being this relaxed.

At some point I made it too complicated [while I could have been exchanging queens away](https://lichess.org/C6LUYTeU/white#34).
In the resulting position his pawn structure would have been broken and my two bishops would have been in total control.

Since I've adopted this approach of analysing my own games and focusing on time management, I can see my ELO rating going back up quite fast:
