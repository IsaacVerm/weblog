My weblog isn't dead but it's not as active as it used to be either. Time to kickstart things again. I think the key thing I'm missing at the momentis having a way to create small notes on a regular basis. I do have posts and research notes but both of these are in long format. I keep short notes in Obsidian but they're kept private. Something for good reason because they're about my private life, other times it would be interesting to share them.

The solution is to have a section public notes with entries marked by day. By day doesn't mean I aim to add new notes everyday, but I do aim for frequent updates. The topics could be diverse: some comments on an interesting article, something I started to research, a code snippet. Just about anything. If I notice I keep on working on the same topic for a longer time, I can always turn them into longer posts or research notes. It's easier to go from something small and concrete to something more fleshed out instead of trying to do the inverse and overreaching.

A good candidate for short entries is chess analysis. After playing a game I can just add the most remarkable thing about the game in a note. If I ever create lots of notes in this way, I can always compile them in a separate post or page.

A habit I used to have is focusing on playing just 3 chess games but as focused as possible.
Afterwards I can see if there any highlights, things to remember about these games.

In Blitz games I often end up basic mistakes like hanging a piece.
[In this game](https://lichess.org/9RlPi3nO/white#47) I was afraid of losing the a4 pawn in a fork of his queen on a1.
But I completely forgot about the more important issue of keeping the bishop on e2 protected.
I have to keep a basic safety check in mind all the time.
Think a few seconds if pieces are safe or not, it's worth it in the longer run.
