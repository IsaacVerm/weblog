    <p>
        Why a separate page for research notes?
        Why not just create another post?
        Sometimes I'm interested in exploring a topic in depth, but I'm not sure yet where things might lead.
        The topic might turn out to be a dead end or it might be very broad.
        That's why I need a place just to keep track of my research in these topics without having in mind a direct goal like I'd have for a post.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been keeping notes on topics I'm interested in for a while now, but kept these private.
        Problem doing this is they can't be shared that easily.
        By making them public, I can just share the link with anyone who might be interested.
