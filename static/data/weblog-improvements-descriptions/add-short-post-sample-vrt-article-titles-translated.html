    I recently started reading Lovecraft again.
    The language used by Lovecraft is always rather convoluted:

    <blockquote>
    Being told of the cat-and-dog fight about to occur in the Blue Pencil Club—a new thing for your circle, perhaps, though not unfamiliar to amateurdom as a whole—I cannot resist contributing a few Thomasic yowls and sibilants upon my side of the dispute, though conscious that the word of a venerable ex-member can scarcely have much weight against the brilliancy of such still active adherents as may bark upon the other side.
    </blockquote>

    For example I had never heard the word "thomasic" before.
    Recently I experimented with LLM usage for translation and this works perfectly well.
    You can ask the LLM to explain any difficult words (whatever way you want to define difficulty).
    This makes going through a difficult text a lot easier.
    For example with a very simple prompt you can get something like this:

    <img src="/static/images/weblog-improvements/prompt-lovecraft-difficult-words.jpeg" style="margin-top: 2rem;"/>

    This got me thinking. Recently I've started tracking VRT news articles.
    In 2 weeks I've scraped about 2000 article titles.
    This could be a good combination with the translation approach.
    Samply a few titles randomly and prompt the LLM to ask you to translate them one by one.
    If you don't know a word, you can ask the LLM to explain the word after you went over all of the article titles.
    The orginal prompt can be saved in Datasette llm.

    For now I'm just going to start with a short post about experimenting how to get this right.
    Later on I can turn it into a full-fledged app:

    <ul>
        <li>save words you mark as to remember</li>
        <li>choose filtering options what to consider difficult</li>
        <li>how to split up the sentences</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
