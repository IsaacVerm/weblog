    I've been keeping a list of quotes in Obsidian and for a while I've been thinking about migrating them to this weblog.
    Terse quotes can often be very revealing.
    At first I was thinking about adding those quotes to a separate pages.
    Now I have a page Linkfest though, I think the links fit in perfectly in there.
    Might be good to add a theme field to links.jsonso I later on I can filter out just quotes if I want to.
