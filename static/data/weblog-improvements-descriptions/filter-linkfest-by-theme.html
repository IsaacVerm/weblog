<p>
    Add a button to the Linkfest page to filter links by theme.
    The theme should be a field in links.json.
    Not sure yet what the button should look like, maybe just a dropdown.
    The page shouldn't reload completely, but you can just update what links are displayed.
    You can be generous with the amount of themes.
    No need to be too specific but too general isn't good either.
    No theme like "Verdun early 1917", but no theme "history" either.
