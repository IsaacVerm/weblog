<p>
    I'm writing a post and want to refer to my previous usage of jq.
    The tools page already contains an overview of when I used a tool (including jq).
    I want to add an anchor link so I can point the reader to jq on the tools page directly instead of just to the tools page in general.
    This is just a matter of adding ids to the tool header.

    I'd like to do the same for improvements and the cheatsheet page.
    This is especially useful for improvements.
    Now I just list the posts where I use a tool on the tools page.
    If I have anchor links on the improvements page, I can add improvements to the tools page as well.
