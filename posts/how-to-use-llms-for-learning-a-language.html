    <h1>How to use LLMs for learning a language</h1>
        <h2>introduction</2>
            <h3>Learning Russian is hard</h3>
                <p>I started learning Russian a couple of years ago. There were no deep reasons for that, the main reason being it just had funny letters I couldn't read and that intrigued me. Over the years I've always kept at it, but not always at the same intensity. Sometimes I got really enthusiastic and started grinding vocabulary, sometimes I didn't work on it for months. In any case I never completely lost interest. What made it hard to keep at it consistently was I never really managed to integrate Russian into a more structured learning process. Some structured way of learning the language with visible progress.</p>
            <h3>LLMs as tutors can help with learning the language</h3>
                <p>So I was still thinking about this when in 2022 Large Language Models (LLMs) became mainstream. After a while I started experimenting with them a bit. If you don't know what an LLM is, you probably do know ChatGPT. ChatGPT is the application wrapping the OpenAI LLM. Other LLMs exist as well: you have large closed-source models like <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">Claude</a> but also open-source models ran locally in <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>.</p>
                <p>At first I just used these LLMs for coding, mainly using <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>. After a while I started branching out, using them to do research and basic data cleaning tasks but still I didn't use them for anything related to learning Russian. The trigger for me to give LLMs a try to learn Russian came when I (re)read <a href="https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins">Why we stopped making Einsteins</a>. The article doesn't speak about LLMs directly, but talks about how having a personalised tutor in the past could help students enormously. To me the link to LLMs is clear. LLMs can act as artificial tutors, but in contrast to tutors in the 18th century they're accessible to everyone.. Of course they don't replace real tutors, but when you don't have access to a real tutor they could still be very useful. This personalised form of learning seems to help enormously.</p>
                <h3>A lot of LLM learning potential is lost</h3>
                <p>When talking about this with other people, I noticed there's a lot of hesitance and people are doubtful about the idea of LLMs as tutors being something worth pursuing. In this way it seems clear the main obstacles to unlocking LLMs as a learning tool are societal, not technological. That's about the same way the previous technological revolution, the internet, was received. A good example can be found in the introduction of the Einstein article:</p>
                <blockquote>I think the most depressing fact about humanity is that during the 2000s most of the world was handed essentially free access to the entirety of knowledge and that <em>didn't</em> trigger a golden age.</blockquote>
                <p>I feel like something similar is happening with LLMs now. We now have access to an extreme powerful tool but somehow society doesn't manage to exploit it to its full potential. We're still stuck at the stage of using ChatGPT to write very average summaries, but these LLMs can do so much more. Their usefulness isn't in the tool itself but how you you/society uses it.</p>
            <h3>Practical approach</h3>
                <p>In order to see if my theory of LLMs as tutors holds up, I decided to have another go at learning Russian, but this time LLM-assisted. A large part of the rest of this post will consist of me showing examples of how I leveraged the LLM to improve the learning process. Using examples I want to keep things grounded, avoiding making wild claims saying LLMs are either the end of the world or some kind of superintelligence.</p>
                <p>I'm not claiming my approach of using LLMs would work for anyone, but I can say they do work for me. I'm really convinced having the LLM made learning Russian easier. You still have to do the work yourself, but a lot of hurdles making it hard to get started or get the right information are no longer there.</p>
                <p>I didn't do this in a vacuum. I got a lot of inspiration from other people's writing on the same subjects, mainly <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> and <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/">Nicholas Carlini</a>. Simon Willison's site has a lot of entries, detailing both what worked for him and what didn't. The format of this article itself is heavily inspired by <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html">How I use AI</a>, an article by Carlini. I liked his practical way of writing and tried to do something similar. At first I added a section detailing all the benefits of using LLMs but I ditched that part completely. I hope the examples speak for themselves. I think the best way to get my point is across is to explain what I did with examples and explain the approach taken. The most important part of using these examples is they're real. It's not some marketing pitch. You can check the results yourself, experiment and see what you make of it.</p>
                <p>I don't claim any originality in writing this article. I hope the added value of having another article showing LLM practical examples, is it makes clear you don't have to be a genius to be able to take advantage of what LLMs offer. Carlini works Google DeepMind, I don't and we work on a completely different level but still both of us get some value out of using LLMs. That's something. Next to these lofty aspirations, I also just wanted to take the time to write down what I learned on the topic. Without the format of a blog post I'd probably never get around to doing it. It certainly helped clear my mind on the topic. This is inspired by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up">Andy Matuschak's work with the garage door up</a> article. I want to be able to share these small projects and a blog post seems like the best format to do that.</p>
                <p>At the end of the article I'll take things a bit further, moving beyond just the examples and I'll go over what lessons can be learned from these examples. This combination of practically getting in touch with reality and at the same time thinking about what exactly you're doing and how it fits the bigger whole yields the best results in my opinion. It is the most interesting approach for yourself as well. Not sterile but lively.</p>
                <p>Repeating myself, but the point I really want to get across is LLMs already are very useful (they certainly are to me) and I'd be surprised they wouldn't be useful to a lot of other people as well. I completely agree with how Nicholas Carlini articulates it in <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html">How I use AI</a>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>So when people say things like "LLMs are just hype" and that all LLM provide no tangible value to anyone, it's obvious to me they are just wrong, because they provide <em>me</em> value. Now maybe I'm the exception. Maybe I'm the only one who's found a way to make these models useful. I can only speak for myself. But given that LLMs can significantly improve <em>my</em> productivity---someone who has been programming for 20 years before ever using a LLM---I suspect that there are other people out there who could benefit from them as well.</p>
                    <p>But there seem to be a (large?) contingent of people out there---in the academic literature, in the software engineering space, and also in the media sphere---who proclaim widely that LLMs contribute nothing, are just another hype cycle, and in a few years will die having had no impact on the world. I will be arguing these people are wrong because current LLMs are already useful.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>There's certainly a lot of marketing and hype around everything LLM. But in my opinion they're here to stay so better experiment with them. You can see for yourself what's true and what isn't. Experiment and read up because there's a lot happening (which is good). Before moving on to the main part showing some concrete examples how LLMs can be used when learning a language, I'll first make a small detour. This detour is necessary to fully understand the value LLMs offer as part of a wider ecosystem of applications.</p>
