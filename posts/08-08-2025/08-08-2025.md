Want to give [Val Town](https://www.val.town/) a try:

> Run Automations in TypeScript - Zapier for know code engineers

Had a first try with some of the examples and things are really easy to set up.
I like the fact [e-mail support](https://docs.val.town/vals/email/) is stressed.
This would be a very good setup for a RSS reader.
Every day it could send a mail (to me or others) with the links of my favorite blogs, sites,...

Lots of people do cool stuff with Val Town, like [setting up a RAG system](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/21/search-based-rag/).

Should start creating some pages for topics I always return to.
Right now I keep these in Obsidian notes, but these are not public so can't be shared.
For example I'm interested in how LLM evaluations work.
I read some interesting articles recently on this topic:

- [Building a SNAP LLM eval: part 1](https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-1/)
- [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/index.html)
