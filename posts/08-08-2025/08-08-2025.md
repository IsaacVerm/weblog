Want to give [Val Town](https://www.val.town/) a try:

> Run Automations in TypeScript - Zapier for know code engineers

Had a first try with some of the examples and things are really easy to set up.
I like the fact [e-mail support](https://docs.val.town/vals/email/) is stressed.
This would be a very good setup for a RSS reader.
Every day it could send a mail (to me or others) with the links of my favorite blogs, sites,...

Lots of people do cool stuff with Val Town, like [setting up a RAG system](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/21/search-based-rag/).

Should start creating some pages for topics I always return to.
Right now I keep these in Obsidian notes, but these are not public so can't be shared.
For example I'm interested in how LLM evaluations work.
I read some interesting articles recently on this topic:

- [Building a SNAP LLM eval: part 1](https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-1/)
- [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/index.html)

> Q: Is it true that there is freedom of speech in the USSR, just like in the USA?
> 
> A: Yes. In the USA, you can stand in front of the White House in Washington, DC, and yell, "Down with Ronald Reagan," and you will not be punished. Equally, you can also stand in Red Square in Moscow and yell, "Down with Ronald Reagan," and you will not be punished.

> What I've called the “new grad gap”—that is, the difference in unemployment between recent grads and the overall economy—just set a modern record.

> We depend on a calculator to produce identical results no matter who uses it, but identical results in a writing context are boring at best.

[Why English doesn’t use accents](https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents):

> It may surprise you to read that English is written without diacritics due to French influence. After all, French is written with plenty of diacritics: écouter ‘listen’, à ‘to’, château ‘castle’, Noël ‘Christmas’, Français ‘French’.
>
> But the French that the Normans brought to England was not French as it’s spoken and written today: it was a different, older form of the language — and one written very differently from the French you would find in a livre today.
>
> One big difference between the French of 1066 and the French of 2025 is in the use of diacritics. Diacritics only became a part of standard French writing much, much later than the time of the Norman Conquest. So the French brought over by the Normans was written without them. And when these scribes took up the task of writing English, they carried over their French habits of writing.
