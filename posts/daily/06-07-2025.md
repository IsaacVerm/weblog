My weblog isn't dead but it's not as active as it used to be either. Time to kickstart things again. I think the key thing I'm missing at the moment is having a way to create small notes on a regular basis. I do have posts and research notes but both of these are in long format. I keep short notes in Obsidian but they're kept private. Sometimes for a good reason because they're about my private life, other times it would be interesting to share them more publicly.

The solution is to have a section public notes with entries marked by day. Organizing these notes by day doesn't mean I aim to add new notes every day, but I do aim for frequent updates. The topics could be diverse: some comments on an interesting article, something I started to research, a code snippet. Just about anything. If I notice I keep on working on the same topic for a longer time, I can always turn them into longer posts or research notes. It's easier to go from something small and concrete to something more fleshed out instead of trying to do the reverse and overreaching.

Chess analysis is a good candidate for short, public notes. After playing a game I can just add the most remarkable thing about the game in a note. If I ever create lots of notes in this way, I can always compile them in a separate post or page.

A habit I used to have is focusing on playing just 3 chess games but as focused as possible.
Afterwards I can check if there are any highlights, things to remember about these games.

In Blitz games I often end up making basic mistakes like hanging a piece.
[In this game](https://lichess.org/9RlPi3nO/white#47) I was afraid of losing the a4 pawn to a fork with his queen on a1. But I completely forgot about the more important issue of keeping the bishop on e2 protected.
I have to keep a basic safety check in mind all the time.
Think a few seconds if pieces are safe or not, it's worth it in the longer run.

The game after I made another basic mistake: Bxd7 and he wins my queen after the discovered attack.
I didn't blunder the piece directly but my safety radar was clearly off. If you move your queen in the line of your opponent's rook, you should think twice.

The final game out of these 3 games was a wild rollercoaster:

Mistakes made were very clear and insightful:

In this position I went into defensive mode way too quickly.
He took my pawn and the only thing I thought about was moving my piece away, although his own piece was hanging. In the end I did win the game in a time scramble.
Goes to show you should always keep going on, even after a massive blunder like the one above.
