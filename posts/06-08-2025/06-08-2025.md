I'm still looking for decent reasons to use [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) over just using this repo to store Markdown files related to my blog.
I feel like just having a way to store text files + linking between them is about 95% of what I want to do.
The remaining 5% can be resolved in side projects, each within their own repo.

One possible reason to migrate to GitHub Pages could be its support for frontmatter.
[Frontmatter is metadata (e.g. tags) you don't want to show up in your document](https://github.com/Kernix13/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/frontmatter.md#what-exactly-is-frontmatter).
Content in GitHub repos is parsed using the GitHub Flavored Markdown dialect.
This dialect doesn't support frontmatter.
When it encounters frontmatter, this will be displayed just as regular text.
At the moment I don't use frontmatter yet though.
