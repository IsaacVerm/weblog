Just as before, playing 3 Blitz games.

First game I hung my queen because I missed a fork:

I should have paid attention since his knight was already advancing quite far.

Second game I played till the very end which shows some fighting spirit.I started off strong but then I didn't focus on a single good attacking idea.

The obvious idea is Qg4 preparing to infiltrate and mate his king.
Always keep a good attacking idea in mind when you're ahead.

The last game I played too aggressive without having a concrete plan:

I should have just gotten rid of his c5 pawn because this pawn later on became a real thorn in my thigh:

Luckily for me [the game was very sharp](https://lichess.org/eawIJz6X/black#40) and I could take advantage of a tactical blunder of his.

[chess-dashboard](https://github.com/IsaacVerm/chess-dashboard) is working fine, it's calculating key metrics about my chess play on a daily basis (just the win/score percentage for now though) so now I can build upon this:

- add automatically updating graphs
- add more metrics
- ...
